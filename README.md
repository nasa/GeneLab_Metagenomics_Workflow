# GeneLab Metagenomics Sequencing Data Processing Workflow <!-- omit in toc -->

> GeneLab, part of NASA's [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://www.nasa.gov/osdr/), has wrapped each step of the [Standard short-read](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Illumina/) (starting with pipeline version B) and [Low Biomass short-read and long-read](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Low_Biomass/) metagenomics sequencing data processing pipelines into a single Nextflow workflow (NF_MetagenomeSeq). This repository contains information about the workflow along with instructions for installation and usage. Exact workflow run info and NF_MetagenomeSeq version used to process specific datasets hosted on the [OSDR data repository](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/) are provided alongside their processed data in OSDR under 'Files' -> 'GeneLab Processed Metagenomics Files' -> 'Processing Info'.

## General Workflow Info <!-- omit in toc -->

### Implementation Tools <!-- omit in toc -->

The current GeneLab metagenomics sequencing data processing pipelines ([Standard short-read](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Illumina/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7107_Versions/GL-DPPD-7107-B.md), [Low biomass short-read](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Low_Biomass/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7117_Versions/GL-DPPD-7117.md), and [Low biomass long-read](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Low_Biomass/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7116_Versions/GL-DPPD-7116.md)) are implemented as a single [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/) DSL2 workflow that utilizes [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.10/user-guide/introduction.html) containers, [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) containers, or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environments to install/run all tools. This workflow is run using the command line interface (CLI) of any unix-based system.  While knowledge of creating workflows in Nextflow is not required to run the workflow as-is, the [Nextflow documentation](https://docs.seqera.io/nextflow/) is a useful resource for users who want to modify and/or extend this workflow.

The NF_MetagenomeSeq workflow is composed of 4 main subworkflows that implement the 
3 GeneLab Metagenomics pipelines as well as a variant of GL-DPPD-7116 that omits 
the decontamination steps for datasets that lack No Template Control samples which 
are needed for decontamination:
1) Standard short-read Metagenomics data processing [GL-DPPD-7107-B](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Illumina/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7107_Versions/GL-DPPD-7107-B.md)
2) Low-biomass short-read Metagenomics data processing [GL-DPPD-7117](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Low_Biomass/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7117_Versions/GL-DPPD-7117.md)
3) Low-biomass long-read Metagenomics data processing [GL-DPPD-7116](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Low_Biomass/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7116_Versions/GL-DPPD-7116.md)

### 1. Install Nextflow, Singularity, and Conda

#### 1a. Install Nextflow and Conda

Nextflow can be installed either through the [Anaconda bioconda channel](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/nextflow) or as documented in the [Nextflow installation documentation](https://docs.seqera.io/nextflow/install).

> [!TIP]
> If you wish to install Conda, we recommend installing a Miniforge version appropriate for your system, as documented on the [conda-forge website](https://conda-forge.org/download/), where you can find basic binaries for most systems. More detailed miniforge documentation is available in the [miniforge github repository](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).
> 
> Once Conda is installed on your system, you can install the latest version of Nextflow by running the following commands:
> 
> ```bash
> conda install -c bioconda nextflow
> nextflow self-update
> ```
> You may also install [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) first which is a faster implementation of Conda and can be used as a drop-in replacement:
> ```bash
> conda install -c conda-forge mamba
> ```

<br>

#### 1b. Install Singularity

Singularity is a platform that allows usage of containerized software. This enables the GeneLab workflow to retrieve and use all software required for processing without the need to install the software directly on the user's system.

We recommend installing Singularity on a system wide level as per the associated [documentation](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.10/admin-guide/admin_quickstart.html).

> [!TIP]
> - Singularity is also available through the [Anaconda conda-forge channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/singularity). 
> - Alternatively, Docker can be used in place of Singularity. To get started with Docker, see the [Docker CE installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

<br>

---

### 2. Download the Workflow Files

All files required for utilizing the GeneLab metagenomics workflow for processing either short- or long-read sequencing data are available in this repository. To get a copy of the latest workflow version on to your system, clone this repository then `cd` into the repository directory by running the following commands: 

```bash
wget https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Metagenomics_Workflow/releases/download/v1.0.0-beta/NF_MetagenomeSeq_1.0.0-beta.zip

unzip NF_MetagenomeSeq_1.0.0-beta.zip 
cd NF_MetagenomeSeq_1.0.0-beta/
```

<br>

---

### 3. Fetch Singularity Images

Although Nextflow can fetch Singularity images from a url, doing so may cause issues as detailed [here](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/issues/1210).

To avoid this issue, run the following command to fetch the Singularity images prior to running the GeneLab NF_MetagenomeSeq workflow:

> [!NOTE]
> *This command should be run from within the `NF_MetagenomeSeq_1.0.0-beta` directory that was downloaded in [step 2](#2-download-the-workflow-files) above. Depending on your network speed, fetching the images will take ~20 minutes. Approximately 4GB of RAM is needed to download and build the Singularity images.*

```bash
bash ./bin/prepull_singularity.sh config/*.config
```

Once complete, a `singularity` directory containing the Singularity images will be created. Run the following command to export this folder as a Nextflow configuration environment variable to ensure Nextflow can locate the fetched images:

```bash
export NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=$(pwd)/singularity
```

<br>

---

### 4. Run the Workflows

<br>

For options and detailed help on how to run the workflow directly on the command-line, run the following command:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf --help
```

There are also two additional documentation files available:
- A quick reference with the most frequently needed information: [GeneLab_NF_MetagenomeSeq_Workflow_Quick_Reference.md](./GeneLab_NF_MetagenomeSeq_Workflow_Quick_Reference.md) 
- More detailed documentation of each option: [GeneLab_NF_MetagenomeSeq_Workflow_Documentation.md](./GeneLab_NF_MetagenomeSeq_Workflow_Documentation.md). 


<br>

> [!NOTE]
> - All commands in this section assume that the workflow will be run from within the `NF_MetagenomeSeq_1.0.0-beta` directory that was downloaded in [step 2](#2-download-the-workflow-files) above. They may also be run from a different location by providing full paths to the main.nf, and nextflow.config workflow files in the `NF_MetagenomeSeq_1.0.0-beta` directory.  
> - Nextflow commands use both single hyphen arguments (e.g. -help) that denote general Nextflow arguments and double hyphen arguments (e.g. --input_file) that denote workflow specific parameters.  Take care to use the proper number of hyphens for each argument.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ***Human Read Removal:***  
> - The short-read workflows assume that human reads have already been removed from the datasets. If human reads have not been removed from short-read data, please run the [Human reads removal workflow](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/Metagenomics/Remove_human_reads_from_raw_data/Workflow_Documentation) on your dataset before running this workflow.  
> - Long-read workflows incorporate human read removal after the filter/trim steps to account for the lower read quality inherent in long read data. Do not run separate human read removal on the raw data prior running the long-read workflows.

<br>


#### 4a. Standard Short Read Workflow

The GeneLab Metagenomics Standard Short Read workflow is designed to process data generated from short-read
platforms such as [Illumina](https://www.illumina.com/) using the [GeneLab Metagenomics Standard Short Read Pipeline](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Illumina/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7107_Versions/GL-DPPD-7107-B.md). 
Below are 2 different approaches for running the workflow, depending on the input files provided.


##### 4a.i. Approach 1: Start with paired-end FASTQ files as input

```bash
nextflow run main.nf -resume \
    -profile singularity  \
    --sample_type "standard" \
    --input_file PE_file.csv \
    --errorStrategy "ignore" \
    --technology "illumina"
```

##### 4a.ii. Approach 2: Start with single-end FASTQ files as input

```bash
nextflow run main.nf -resume \
    -profile singularity \
    --sample_type "standard" \
    --input_file SE_file.csv \
    --errorStrategy "ignore" \
    --technology "illumina"
```

<br>

#### 4b. Low Biomass Short Read Workflow

The GeneLab Metagenomics Low Biomass Short Read workflow is designed to process low biomass data generated from 
short-read platforms such as [Illumina](https://www.illumina.com/) using the 
[GeneLab Metagenomics Low Biomass Short Read Pipeline](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Low_Biomass/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7117_Versions/GL-DPPD-7117.md). Below are 2 
different approaches for running the workflow, depending on the input files provided.


##### 4b.i. Approach 1: Start with paired-end FASTQ files as input

```bash
nextflow run main.nf -resume \
    -profile singularity  \
    --sample_type "low_biomass" \
    --input_file PE_file.csv \
    --errorStrategy "ignore" \
    --technology "illumina"
```

##### 4b.ii. Approach 2: Start with single-end FASTQ files as input

```bash
nextflow run main.nf -resume \
    -profile singularity \
    --sample_type "low_biomass" \
    --input_file SE_file.csv \
    --errorStrategy "ignore" \
    --technology "illumina"
```

<br>

**Required Parameters For All Short Read Approaches:**

* `-profile` – Specifies the configuration [profile](config/profiles.config) to load (multiple options can be provided as a comma-separated list)
   * Software environment profile options (choose one):
      * `singularity` - instructs Nextflow to use Singularity container environments
      * `docker` - instructs Nextflow to use Docker container environments
      * `conda` - instructs Nextflow to use Conda environments via the Conda package manager
      * `mamba` - instructs Nextflow to use Conda environments via the Mamba package manager 
        > *Note: By default, Nextflow will create Conda and Mamba  environments at runtime using the yaml files in the [envs](envs/) folder. You can change this behavior by using the `--conda_*` workflow parameters to adjust individual environments or by editing the [profiles](config/profiles.config) config file to specify the path where Conda or Mamba environments are stored using the `conda.cacheDir` parameter.*
   * Other option (can be combined with the software environment option above using a comma, e.g. `-profile slurm,singularity`):
      * `slurm` - instructs Nextflow to use the [Slurm cluster management and job scheduling system](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html) to schedule and run the jobs on a Slurm HPC cluster
* `main.nf` - Instructs Nextflow to run the Genelab Metagenomics workflow. If running in a directory other than `NF_MetagenomeSeq_1.0.0-beta`, replace with the full path to the main.nf workflow file.
* `--sample_type` - Specifies the type of sample to be analyzed. One of "standard" or "low_biomass" for standard and low biomass sample types, respectively. 
terminated may require a lot of time and disk space. Set to "terminate" if you'd want to terminate the workflow when an error is encountered.
* `--technology "illumina"` - Specifies the technology type used to generate the sequencing data.
* `--input_file *.csv` - Specifies the input csv file containing required metadata about the samples including paths to the input file(s) for each sample.
  * > *Note: These input files require specific formatting to be interpreted correctly. Please see the [runsheet documentation](examples/runsheet) in this repository for examples on how to format this file type for each approach.*

**Optional Parameters Recommended for All Short Read Approaches and Used in the Examples Above:**
* `-resume` - Resumes workflow execution using previously cached results. Not required on first run, but including it just results in a warning and proceeds with normal execution.
* `--errorStrategy "ignore"` - Instructs Nextflow to continue processing the dataset if an error is encountered in any step. The Nextflow default is 'terminate', which interrupts all running processes at the time of error including those that would not have failed otherwise. The default behavior can be expensive in time and disk space used.

<br>

#### 4e. Monitoring runs on Seqera Platform

Seqera Platform, previously known as Nextflow Tower, is the centralized command post for data management and workflows. It brings monitoring, logging and observability to distributed workflows and simplifies the deployment of workflows on any cloud, cluster, or laptop.

For instructions on how to setup Seqera Platform please see the documentation [here](https://training.nextflow.io/2.0.1/basic_training/seqera_platform/). After you set up the Seqera Platform, simply add the `-with-tower` flag to the Nextflow command to monitor your run on the platform. For example:

```bash
export TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN=eyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxQ1ZTE=
# Example command for the Low Biomass Long Read Approach 3 using Seqera Platform
nextflow run main.nf -resume \
    -with-tower \
    -profile singularity \
    --sample_type "low_biomass" \
    --input_file single.csv \
    --input_type "single" \
    --errorStrategy "ignore" \
    --technology "nanopore"
```

> [!TIP]
> The helper scripts [launch.sh](launch.sh) and [launch.slurm](launch.slurm) can be used to launch the workflow and to submit 
> your run to seqera platform for workflow monitoring. Please see the scripts on how to modify and run them after setting the 
> required paths, parameters, and variables.

#### 4f. Modify parameters and compute resources in the Nextflow config file

Additionally, all parameters and workflow resources can be directly specified by modifying them in the [default](config/default.config), [illumina](config/illumina.config), [nanopore](config/nanopore.config) and [parameters](config/params.config) config files. For detailed instructions on how to modify and set parameters in the config files, please see the [Nextflow configuration documentation](https://docs.seqera.io/nextflow/config). 

Once you've downloaded the workflow template, you can modify the parameters in the `params` scope of the [params.config](config/params.config) file. The cpus/memory requirements can be modified in the `process` scope in the [default.config](config/default.config), [illumina.config](config/illumina.config) and [nanopore.config](config/nanopore.config) files as needed in order to match your dataset and system setup for default, illumina, and nanopore configuration settings, respectively. Workflow profiles can be modified by editing the [profiles.config](config/profiles.config) file. Finally, you can modify each variable in the config files above to be consistent with the study you want to process and the computer you're using for processing.

* The outputs from the GeneLab Standard Long Read Metagenomics workflow include all files documented for the GeneLab Low Biomass Long Read Metagenomics workflow except those associated with the decontamination steps.

#### 5b. Resource Logs

Standard Nextflow resource usage logs are produced as follows:

**Nextflow Resource Usage Logs**
   - Resource_Usage/execution_report_{timestamp}.html (an html report that includes metrics about the workflow execution including computational resources and exact workflow process commands)
   - Resource_Usage/execution_timeline_{timestamp}.html (an html timeline for all processes executed in the workflow)
   - Resource_Usage/execution_trace_{timestamp}.txt (an execution tracing file that contains information about each process executed in the workflow, including: submission time, start time, completion time, cpu and memory used, machine-readable output)

> Further details about these logs can also found in the [Nextflow Report Documentation](https://docs.seqera.io/nextflow/reports).

## General Workflow Info

### Implementation Tools

The current GeneLab metagenomics sequencing data processing pipelines, [Low biomass long-read](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/DEV_Metagenomics_low_biomass/Metagenomics/Low_Biomass/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7116_Versions), [Low biomass short-read](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/DEV_Metagenomics_low_biomass/Metagenomics/Low_Biomass/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7117_Versions), [Standard long-read](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/DEV_Metagenomics/Metagenomics/Nanopore) and [Standard short-read](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/DEV_Metagenomics/Metagenomics/Illumina) are implemented as a [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/) DSL2 workflow and utilizes [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.10/user-guide/introduction.html) containers, [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) containers, or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environments to install/run all tools. This workflow is run using the command line interface (CLI) of any unix-based system.  While knowledge of creating workflows in Nextflow is not required to run the workflow as is, [the Nextflow documentation](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html) is a useful resource for users who want to modify and/or extend this workflow.   

### Resource Requirements <!-- omit in toc -->

The table below details the default maximum resource allocations for individual Nextflow processes.

| CPU Cores | Memory |
|--------------------|------------------|
| 10                 | 300 GB           |

> **Note:** These per-process resource allocations are defaults. They can be adjusted by modifying `cpus` and `memory` directives in the  [default.config](config/default.config), [illumina.config](config/illumina.config) and [nanopore.config](config/nanopore.config) configuration files.

### 1. Install Nextflow, Singularity, and Conda

#### 1a. Install Nextflow and Conda

Nextflow can be installed either through the [Anaconda bioconda channel](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/nextflow) or as documented on the [Nextflow documentation page](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html).


> Note: If you wish to install conda, we recommend installing a Miniforge version appropriate for your system, as documented on the [conda-forge website](https://conda-forge.org/download/), where you can find basic binaries for most systems. More detailed miniforge documentation is available in the [miniforge github repository](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).
> 
> Once conda is installed on your system, you can install the latest version of Nextflow by running the following commands:
> 
> ```bash
> conda install -c bioconda nextflow
> nextflow self-update
> ```
> You may also install [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) first which is a faster implementation of conda and can be used as a drop-in replacement:
> ```bash
> conda install -c conda-forge mamba
> ```

<br>

#### 1b. Install Singularity

Singularity is a container platform that allows usage of containerized software. This enables the GeneLab workflow to retrieve and use all software required for processing without the need to install the software directly on the user's system.

We recommend installing Singularity on a system wide level as per the associated [documentation](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.10/admin-guide/admin_quickstart.html).

> Note: Singularity is also available through the [Anaconda conda-forge channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/singularity).

> Note: Alternatively, Docker can be used in place of Singularity. To get started with Docker, see the [Docker CE installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### 2. Download the Workflow Files

All files required for utilizing the GeneLab metagenomics workflow for processing either short- or long-read sequencing data are available in this repository. To get a copy of the latest workflow version on to your system, clone this repository then `cd` into the repository directory by running the following commands: 

```bash
wget https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Metagenomics_Workflow/releases/download/v1.0.0/NF_Metagenomics_1.0.0.zip

unzip NF_Metagenomics_1.0.0.zip 
cd NF_Metagenomics_1.0.0/
```

<br>

---

### 3. Fetch Singularity Images

Although Nextflow can fetch Singularity images from a url, doing so may cause issues as detailed [here](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/issues/1210).

To avoid this issue, run the following command to fetch the Singularity images prior to running the GeneLab metagenomics workflow:

> Note: This command should be run from within the `NF_Metagenomics_1.0.0` directory that was downloaded in [step 2](#2-download-the-workflow-files) above. Depending on your network speed, fetching the images will take ~20 minutes. Approximately 4GB of RAM is needed to download and build the Singularity images.

```bash
bash ./bin/prepull_singularity.sh config/*.config
```

Once complete, a `singularity` directory containing the Singularity images will be created. Run the following command to export this folder as a Nextflow configuration environment variable to ensure Nextflow can locate the fetched images:

```bash
export NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=$(pwd)/singularity
```

<br>

---

### 4. Run the Workflows

For options and detailed help on how to run the workflow, run the following command:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf --help
```

> **Notes:**
> - All the commands in this step assume that the workflow will be run from within the `NF_Metagenomics_1.0.0` directory that was downloaded in [step 2](#2-download-the-workflow-files) above. They may also be run from a different location by providing full paths to the main.nf, and nextflow.config workflow files in the `NF_Metagenomics_1.0.0` directory.*
>
> - Nextflow commands use both single hyphen arguments (e.g. -help) that denote general Nextflow arguments and double hyphen arguments (e.g. --input_file) that denote workflow specific parameters.  Take care to use the proper number of hyphens for each argument.

#### 4e. Monitoring runs on seqera platforms

Seqera Platform, previously known as Nextflow Tower, is the centralized command post for data management and workflows. It brings monitoring, logging and observability to distributed workflows and simplifies the deployment of workflows on any cloud, cluster or laptop.

For instructions on how to setup Sequera Platforms please see the documentation [here](https://training.nextflow.io/2.0.1/basic_training/seqera_platform/). Once you have Seqera platforms set up by following the instructions in the link, you simply need to add the `-with-tower` flag to the nextflow command to monitor your run on the platform. For example:

```bash
export TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN=eyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxQ1ZTE=
# Example command for the Nanopre Approach 3 using Nextflow tower
nextflow run main.nf -resume \
    -with-tower \
    -profile singularity \
    --sample_type "low_biomass" \
    --input_file single.csv \
    --input_type "single" \
    --errorStrategy "ignore" \
    --technology "nanopore"
```

> *Note: These helper scripts [launch.sh](launch.sh) and [launch.slurm](launch.slurm) can be used to launch the workflow from anywhere and to submit your run to seqera platforms for workflow monitoring. Please see the scripts on how to run them after setting the required paths, parameters and variables.* 
<br>

#### 4f. Modify parameters and compute resources in the Nextflow config file

Additionally, all parameters and workflow resources can be directly specified by modifying them in the [default](config/default.config),[illumina](config/illumina.config), [nanopore](config/nanopore.config) and [parameters](config/params.config) files . For detailed instructions on how to modify and set parameters in the config files, please see the [documentation here](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html).

Once you've downloaded the workflow template, you can modify the parameters in the `params` scope of the [params.config](config/params.config) file. The cpus/memory requirements can be modified in the `process` scope in the [default.config](config/default.config), [illumina.config](config/illumina.config) and [nanopore.config](config/nanopore.config) files as needed in order to match your dataset and system setup for default, illumina and nanopore configuration settings, respectively. Workflow profiles can be modified by editing the [profiles.config](config/profiles.config) file. Finally, you can modify each variable in the config files above to be consistent with the study you want to process and the computer you're using for processing.

#### 5a. Main Outputs

* The outputs from the GeneLab Standard Long Read Metagenomics workflow are documented in the [GL-DPPD-7XXX](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/DEV_Metagenomics_low_biomass/Metagenomics/Nanopore/GL-DPPD-7XXX.md) processing pipeline.

* The outputs from the GeneLab Low Biomass Long Read Metagenomics workflow are documented in the [GL-DPPD-7116](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/DEV_Metagenomics_low_biomass/Metagenomics/Low_Biomass/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7116_Versions/GL-DPPD-7116.md) processing pipeline.

* The outputs from the GeneLab Standard Short Read Metagenomics workflow are documented in the [GL-DPPD-7107-A](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/DEV_Metagenomics_low_biomass/Metagenomics/Illumina/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7107_Versions/GL-DPPD-7107-A.md) processing pipeline.
  
* The outputs from the GeneLab Low Biomass Short Read Metagenomics workflow are documented in the [GL-DPPD-7117](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/DEV_Metagenomics_low_biomass/Metagenomics/Low_Biomass/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7117_Versions/GL-DPPD-7117.md) processing pipeline.

#### 5b. Resource Logs

Standard Nextflow resource usage logs are also produced as follows:

**Nextflow Resource Usage Logs**
   - Resource_Usage/execution_report_{timestamp}.html (an html report that includes metrics about the workflow execution including computational resources and exact workflow process commands)
   - Resource_Usage/execution_timeline_{timestamp}.html (an html timeline for all processes executed in the workflow)
   - Resource_Usage/execution_trace_{timestamp}.txt (an execution tracing file that contains information about each process executed in the workflow, including: submission time, start time, completion time, cpu and memory used, machine-readable output)

> Further details about these logs can also found within [this Nextflow documentation page](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html#execution-report).
